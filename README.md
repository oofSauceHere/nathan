This program listens to audio, transforms it, and outputs it. The transformations include:

1) words ending in "er" => "\_\_\_er? I hardly know 'er!"
2) "me and \_\_\_" => "\_\_\_ and i"

That's it. That's all it does.

I did this to make my friends mad. Lol! But jokes aside, it was a decently useful starter project for learning about virtual audio cables and how to deal with them. This code wouldn't work without [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/), because it relies on outputting audio to the microphone, something that can't be done with vanilla audio. At least, not to my knowledge.
