This code listens to Discord audio for words ending in "er" and outputs the following audio to the microphone: "___er? I hardly know 'er!" Uses gTTS for text-to-speech and whisper for speech recognition.

I did this to make my friends mad. Lol! But jokes aside, it was a decently useful starter project for learning about virtual audio cables and how to deal with them. This code wouldn't work without [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/), because it relies on outputting audio to the microphone, something that can't be done with vanilla audio. At least, not to my knowledge.
